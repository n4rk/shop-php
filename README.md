# shop-php
This is an E-commerce website that I made using pure PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JQuery.

To check the website :
1) You will need to install a web server solution stack package such as "XAMPP".
2) In case you're using XAMPP, download the project and extract the files in xampp/htdocs/
3) Go to your localhost/phpmyadmin.
4) Create a new database and name it "ecommerce".
5) Go to import section, and import the sql file named "ecommerce.sql" that is located in ressources folder.
